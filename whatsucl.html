        <h1>What's the UEFA Champions League?</h1>
        <p>The UEFA Champions League is an yearly club football competition made by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested
         by top teams all over Europe. In my opinion, it is the most prestigious club competition in European football.</p>
        <p>Teams qualify for the UEFA Champions League based on their performance in their domestic leagues. So for example in Spain, the league is called La Liga, 
         and currently the teams who finish in the top 4 spots in the league at the end of the season qualify for the upcoming Champions League competition. It's very similar to the 1st Division leagues
         in other countries as well such as England, Germany, etc. </p>
        <p>The tournament begins with a group stage, with 8 groups of 4 teams, followed by knockout rounds leading to the final, which is usually played in a different European city each year.
            This year, it will be held at Wembley Stadium, which is in England and is where my team, F.C. Barcelona, completely dismantled Manchester United and won the final back in 2011, so we'll be hoping to repeat history this year.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite team is FC Barcelona, and in my opinion we aren't really one of the stronger teams in the final 8.
         I believe we've struggled quite a bit in our domestic league and in other competitions, not only in terms of results but we can play some very poor, unappealing football
         at times. However, I will admit we have been doing a lot better in the past month or so, so I have faith that we can go far in this competition!</p>
